# Products List App
This project is developed as a takehome project. It is a basic quiz application. This project has two sides: 'server' and 'client'. 'server' is the back-end Api where the questions and their options are stored and a seeder is created to add five questions and their options to the api. 'client' displays the quiz application in the front-end.
